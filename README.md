# DataSciencePortfolio
This repository intends to showcase the data science projects I have worked on. It will include both personal projects and projects completed as coursework for my BS in Mathematics (Specialization in Data Science) and MS in Applied Statistics.

Final_Classification.html is the report for a classification project completed in my junior year of undergrad for the course Statistical Learning. This course was my first exposure to statistical learning algorithms and one of my first experiences programming in R. This file showcases some of the techniques I learned in this course, and serves as a look at where I began my data science educational journey.
